# Simply Hades 2

Simplicity = QoL.

## Features

Reduced resources used in recipes by an order of magnitude. All resources still exist in the game (to be used by other mods or just to look pretty) but are not used in any vanilla recipes: unlocks, upgrades, incantations, etc.

Made projectiles destroyable by weapon attacks.

Replaced Shadow Incantation repeatable incantation with Bone Transmutation, an incantation that produces Bones from M. Dust and Z. Sand.
Changed the name of repeatable incantations to reflect resources used.

## Install

Use R2Modman, presumably.
